# Code Repositories

Based on the provided PDF research paper, here are the identified official or relevant open-source resources:

*   **APIGen Project Homepage:** `https://apigen-pipeline.github.io/`
    *   **Type:** Project website (hosted on GitHub Pages). This is the official homepage for the APIGen project, which likely contains further information and potentially links to code if it becomes open-source.
*   **APIGen Dataset (Hugging Face):** `https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/xlam-function-calling-60k`
    *   **Type:** Hugging Face Dataset repository. This is the primary output and publicly released artifact of the APIGen pipeline, containing 60,000 high-quality function-calling entries.
*   **Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard:** `https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/leaderboard.html#leaderboard`
    *   **Type:** External Benchmark/Leaderboard. This is a crucial benchmark used by the researchers to evaluate the performance of models trained with APIGen's dataset. While not a code repository for APIGen itself, it's highly relevant to the evaluation and context of the research.

### Best Suited Repository and Extracted Code:

The research paper explicitly states that the **APIGen dataset** is released and available on Hugging Face: `https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/xlam-function-calling-60k`. While this is a *dataset* repository rather than a *code repository* for the APIGen pipeline itself (the paper mentions plans to open-source trained models later, but not the pipeline code at the time of publication), it is the most direct and verifiable "repository" mentioned that allows external users to immediately utilize the primary output of this research.

The "code" from this "repo" would be the structured data that APIGen generates. The paper provides detailed JSON examples of this data format. Below is an example of the generated data format, representing a function-calling query and its expected answer, extracted from **Appendix A.2.2 "Example Data"** (page 14) of the paper, as it directly illustrates the structure of the dataset hosted on Hugging Face.

        },

          "type": "string",
          "description": "The units for temperature measurement (e.g., 'Celsius', 'Fahrenheit').",
